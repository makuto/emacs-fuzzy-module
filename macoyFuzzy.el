;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides a native alternative to `ido-mode''s
;; built-in flex matching.

;;; Acknowledgments

;; Forrest Smith wrote a fuzzy matching algorithm. I took some inspiration from his implementation
;; flx-ido.el is what I looked at to know how to integrate my module into ido.

;;; Installation:

;; You must have compiled your Emacs with --with-modules for it to support modules.
;; Add the following code to your init file:
;;     (setq macoy-fuzzy-library-location "path/to/macoyFuzzy[.dll|.so]")
;;     (require 'macoy-fuzzy-ido)
;;     (ido-mode 1)
;;     (ido-everywhere 1)
;;     (macoy-fuzzy-ido-mode 1)

;;; Code:

(when macoy-fuzzy-library-location
  (module-load macoy-fuzzy-library-location)
  )

(require 'macoy-fuzzy)
;; TODO duplicate and remove
(require 'flx-ido)
(require 'flx)

(defcustom macoy-flx-ido-use-faces t

  :group 'ido)

  "Toggle Macoy fuzzy mode"
  :init-value nil
  :lighter "MacoyFuzzy"
  :group 'ido
  :global t)

;; TODO Remove flx-ido dependency
(defadvice ido-exit-minibuffer (around macoy-fuzzy-ido-reset activate)

         (str (if (consp obj)
                  (car obj)
                obj)))
    (when (and macoy-fuzzy-ido-mode str)
      (remove-text-properties 0 (length str)
                              '(face flx-highlight-face) str)))
